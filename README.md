## 👋 Hi, there

I'm a software developer who is passionate about technology and the opportunity it gives us to build a better future.

Software developer based in Mexico. I transitioned from pursuing university studies in Political Science to immersing myself in the world of tech and development. This shift wasn't arbitrary; I recognized technology as a powerful means to add value and positively impact people's lives. My personal goal is to design and build digital products that truly benefit their users. I am on the lookout for opportunities where I can merge my diverse background with tech innovation to create impactful solutions. 🚀
